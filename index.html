        Guess again. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

        Ow, my spirit! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Professor, make a woman out of me. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Bender, we're trying our best.
        
        Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
        
        Kif might! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!
        
        I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.
        
        Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
        
        Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
        
        Kids have names? You are the last hope of the universe. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! A true inspiration for the children.
        
        As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
        
        It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. You're going to do his laundry?
        
        Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. No, just a regular mistake. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
